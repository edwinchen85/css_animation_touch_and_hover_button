# CSS Animation - Touch And Hover | Button

In this CSS Animation project, we will create and style a green button with a subtle shadow. Then we add animations for hover and active states.

On hover state, the button brightens and scale up and the shadows grow beneath to make it feels like moving further from the page.

Then on active state, button looks pressed down flat with shadow hidden.
